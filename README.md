👋 Hi, I’m @LuqmanHakim!

🎓 I studied at UTM Space. Currently, I'm a part time student in network engineering

💼 I'm currently working as a Data Center Operations Engineer at Iskandar Puteri.

💻 I enjoy coding in C#, and occasionally work with Python, Java, TypeScript, C++, and PHP — though I wouldn’t call myself a full-time developer.

🐳 I'm running a personal homelab with several pet projects — always experimenting and learning!

🛌 Fun fact: I love sleeping.
Have you ever slept for more than 14 hours? I have — and it was unforgettable.
